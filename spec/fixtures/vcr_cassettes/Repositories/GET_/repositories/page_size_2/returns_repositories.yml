        age, ethnic group, and family type.\r\n\r\n4510 people are being followed
        for 20 years. The initial wave of data collection took place in 1987/8, when
        respondents were aged 15, 35 and 55. The final wave of data collection took
        place in 2007/08 when respondents were aged 35, 55 and 75.\r\n\r\nIn this
        way the Twenty-07 Study provides us with unique opportunities to investigate
        both the changes in people''s lives over 20 years and how they affect their

        federal government, the Canadian provinces, the United States, and the private

        environment, these stations receive Earth observation data from several satellites.
        They have created an archive in excess of 270 Terabytes of EO data. Certain
        data sets are delivered in near real time to support applications such as
        ice monitoring by the Canadian Ice Service, since 1991, and forest fire monitoring
        and mapping by the Canadian Forest Service, since 1999. These stations serve
